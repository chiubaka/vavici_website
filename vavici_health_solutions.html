			<h1>Vavici Health Solutions</h1>

			<p>
				Vavici Health Solutions is the first Vavici Capital Company.  The mission of Vavici Health solutions is
				to identify and validate the best health care treatment solutions outside of the academic community
				whether they be from patients, physicians or other alternative health care providers and bring them into
				the main stream by collecting the data in a meaningful way to present to Vavici Foundation participating
				institutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Often a traditional physician will be unable to recommend or suggest a solution that a patient has found
				on the Internet or from an alternative health care provider, not because the solution doesnâ€™t work, but
				because there is insufficient published data.  Even so users and patients often have useful data, but no
				means to express their support or to even provide this information.  As a result patients often find
				themselves at odds with traditional doctors who in turn find themselves unable to participate in the
				growing interest in safer more natural solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Through Vavici Health Solutions physicians and patients will again be able to work together in a
				structure that captures the data meaningfully and which creates a way to track and monitor safety and
				efficacy.  Moreover other health effects and issues can be examined across large groups of patients and
				physicians.  In many cases the numbers of patients and physicians involved may be orders of magnitude
				larger than traditional clinical studies.
