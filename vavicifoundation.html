             <p>
               The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Yet this is exactly what we have been doing in health care for decades. We have continually invested in the kinds of technologies that create and support chronic disease and yet somehow expect that this will result in wellness, prevention, and cures.
   <br><br>
   This becomes obvious when you look objectively at our current state of affairs. Despite the billions of dollars we have spent over the past several decades, the healthcare crisis has gotten worse not better. 75% of all health care costs are caused by chronic diseases and it is this segment that has continued to grow dramatically. Pundits project these costs, currently estimated at nearly $4 Trillion in the US alone, will increase six fold by the year 2050, unless something is changed. Even without this growth, healthcare costs are already the single largest sector of the US economy.
   <br><br>
   We are NOT investing and conducting research in the right areas. The pundits forecasting the continued explosion of our healthcare crisis have made it abundantly clear that they DO NOT believe we are on the right track or that we will have the courage to change this.
   <br><br.
   How did this happen?
   <br><br>
   We applied the patent system to healthcare with the idea that this would encourage people to invest billions of dollars into finding cures. Instead we have invested hundreds of billions of dollars creating products that don’t cure any disease. These are what we now call chronic therapies and are the root cause of the development of chronic diseases. Rather than realize we have made a mistake, we have bought hook line and sinker the story that it is simply very costly to find cures and that it will take more and more money . While it is true that many innovations have positively impacted patients and that some were costly to develop, the belief that our current patent focused research will find cures is flawed. This is because the nature of a cure being something that works effectively with and restores our native biology is usually NOT protectable by patents.
   <br><br.
   For example, when it was found that certain kinds of cells (stem cells) had powerful curative potential, it was quickly observed that natural cells are NOT patentable. So instead of further developing the kind of un-patentable biology that resulted in bone marrow and organ transplants that have saved thousands perhaps millions of lives, we have tried to engineer patent protectable versions we hope will work as good as the real thing. So further development of an un-patentable approach that has and could have resulted in more groundbreaking treatments was abandoned in favor of one that creates patents, but will take many more years and billions more dollars in investments.
   <br><br>
   Vavici Foundation is about focusing on the kinds of research we know will make a difference and then working together to find the business models needed to implement them properly. This doesn’t need to be expensive; in fact some of the most impactful treatments, like the invention of the polio vaccine, which was funded by the March of Dimes, cost less than $40 Million. Curative solutions are by nature much less expensive.
   <br><br>
   The creation of the kinds of business models that will allow us to move treatments that may not be protectable by patents into the mainstream requires leadership and consensus. Vavici will be working with the top thought leading institutions not only to conduct the research we need, but also to build the models needed to implement them. These will be models that focus on getting results and delivering real value. This concept is not new. In fact the most successful companies already focus on this; which is why investments of billions of dollars into these kinds of companies has resulted in innovations that have improved the lives and lowered the costs for millions. It is only in healthcare where the model has been different that we spend billions of dollars to raise the cost and lower the quality of lives for millions.

   We can change this, you can help.
