               Healthcare has become one of the few industries where we can spend billions of dollars on new innovations and yet not improve lives or lower costs. Nearly 40% of the population is obese and a third of us are projected to have type 2 diabetes by the year 2050. Some 75% of all health care costs are caused by chronic diseases like obesity and diabetes.  It is this segment that continues to grow the most rapidly. Pundits project that US healthcare costs, currently estimated at nearly $4 Trillion annually, will increase six fold by the year 2050. Even without this growth, healthcare costs are already the single largest sector of the US economy.  Worse, they have become the greatest threat to retirees nationwide.
   <br><br>
   Both the historical records and the multitude of forecasts for the unrelenting advance of healthcare costs suggest that we have NOT invested and are NOT investing in the right areas.  This is easy to understand when we consider that the predominant focus of research is on addressing disease symptoms not root cause.
   <br><br>
   How did this happen?
   <br><br>
   The Flexner report that ushered in a new era of evidenced based medicine shifted our focus towards a reductionist approach to medicine that favored treating symptoms instead of root cause.  Patents introduced with the goal of encourage people to invest billions of dollars into finding cures were spent instead on creating products that don’t cure any disease. Treatments that do not cure disease came to be called chronic therapies and these in turn supported the growth of chronic diseases. People receiving symptomatic relief often fail to address the root cause of their disease leading to worse disease later. Even worse, people who have symptomatic relief do nothing to discourage others from engaging in the same root cause behaviors and actions that caused their disease.  Many cures it seems are not patentable and so do not receive the investment and marketing dollars that propelled chronic therapies into a multibillion dollar industry.  
   <br><br.
   For example, when it was found that certain kinds of cells (stem cells) had powerful curative potential, it was quickly observed that natural cells are NOT patentable. So instead of further developing the kind of un-patentable biology that resulted in bone marrow and organ transplants that have saved thousands perhaps millions of lives, we have tried to engineer patent protectable versions we hope will work as good as the real thing. So further development of an un-patentable approach that has and could have resulted in more groundbreaking treatments was abandoned in favor of one that creates patents, but will take many more years and billions more dollars in investments.
   <br><br>
   Vavici Foundation is about focusing on the kinds of research we know will make a difference and then working together to find the business models needed to implement them properly. This doesn’t need to be expensive; in fact some of the most impactful treatments, like the invention of the polio vaccine, which was funded by the March of Dimes, cost less than $40 Million. Curative solutions are by nature much less expensive.
   <br><br>
   The creation of the kinds of business models that will allow us to move treatments that may not be protectable by patents into the mainstream requires leadership and consensus. Vavici will be working with the top thought leading institutions not only to conduct the research we need, but also to build the models needed to implement them. These will be models that focus on getting results and delivering real value. This concept is not new. In fact the most successful companies already focus on this; which is why investments of billions of dollars into these kinds of companies has resulted in innovations that have improved the lives and lowered the costs for millions. It is only in healthcare where the model has been different that we spend billions of dollars to raise the cost and lower the quality of lives for millions.

   We can change this, you can help.
