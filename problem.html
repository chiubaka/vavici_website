Despite the tens of billions invested in research and initiatives to treat obesity and diabetes, things have gotten worse NOT better.  Currently over half (60%) of the US population is overweight, nearly half (40%) of the US population is obese, and an alarming one third of the US population is projected to have type 2 diabetes by the year 2050.  Not only are our new R&D efforts not helping, but none of our wellness initiatives are having an impact either.
<br><br>
 

This is happening even though many academic thought leaders know that both obesity and type 2 diabetes is curable.  In fact, many have data showing reversal in less than six months.   These cures are not limited to new diabetics, but includes those who have had diabetes for decades, are taking multiple medication, and hundreds of units of insulin a day.  Data reported by IDM suggests cure rates could be as high as 95%.  
<br><br>


Our primary care doctors do not typically treat obesity and those that treat type 2 diabetes are trained to treat it as a chronic incurable disease.  Instead of being trained to identify and treat the root cause of the type 2 diabetes, they have been taught to focus almost exclusively on addressing disease symptoms.  This means managing blood glucose and disease complications like renal disease, retinopathy, and debilitating ulcers.  Most have little or no training in managing obesity.  
<br><br>


The results have been disastrous.  Millions of Americans now suffer and even die from side effects of obesity and diabetes diseases that we have the means to both prevent and cure.
<br><br>
 

Obesity and type 2 diabetes now represent the single largest contributor to US healthcare costs and to our healthcare crisis.  Estimated at over $1 Trillion dollars annually we now spend one in every three US healthcare dollars on obesity and type 2 diabetes.
