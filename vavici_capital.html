			<h1>Vavici Capital</h1>

			<p>
				While in almost every other industry sector our financial system has driven innovations and efficiencies
				that have lowered costs and improved the lives of millions, this has not been true in healthcare.
				Exceeding GDP growth by 2.5% since 1960 the growth of health care costs is unsustainable and represents
				the single greatest threat to economic security the world over.  Moreover with the dramatic explosion of
				chronic diseases and their attendant morbidities we are not healthier and things are not getting better.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite this harsh reality, the focus of health care investments continues to be on technologies and
				therapies that increase costs and further support rather than eliminate chronic diseases.  We no longer
				produce treatments that even approach the “efficient healthcare frontier” of optimizing outcomes and
				costs.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now more than ever the real opportunity and future of the market is in therapies and technologies that
				lower costs and improve outcomes.  Patients and employers are becoming increasingly dissatisfied with
				the status quo.  They are looking for new leadership and for solutions that make sense.  Just as decades
				ago biotechnology heralded a new generation of business prosperity, health care solutions that make
				sense will create an even more profitable and impactful generation of companies.
			</p>

			<p>
				Vavici Capital, will lead the way towards this disruptive change in focus.  Seeking to liberate the best
				ideas from top academic medical centers across the country, Vavici will first take advantage of the fact
				that many of the solutions that make sense are already known.  They’ve just been overlooked and so were
				never implemented.  In partnership with Vavici Foundation, Vavici Capital will do the heavy lifting of
				creating the new companies out of models developed at Vavici Foundation.  Many of these will be
				service-based companies using best of practice algorithms that address the root cause of our healthcare
				crisis.
			</p>

			<p>
				Instead of focusing on increasingly complex patent protected technologies with high development costs,
				significant regulatory risk and long development timelines before they ever become profitable, Vavici
				will build solution oriented services, using simpler technologies, with validated algorithms that have
				little or no regulatory or development risk that can be profitable right away.
			</p>

			<p>
				 In so doing Vavici Capital will generate superior returns by building health care companies that make
				sense, and which meet the “efficient healthcare frontier” (ie improve outcomes & lower costs).
