			<h1>Vavici Foundation</h1>

			<p>
				The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Yet this is exactly what we have been doing in health care for decades. We have continually invested in the kinds of technologies that create and support chronic disease and yet somehow expect that this will result in wellness, prevention, and cures. Instead we need to harness the vast wealth of knowledge
				already amassed within the top academic centers and work together to create business models that target
				major chronic disease areas. 75% of all health care costs are caused by chronic diseases and it is
				this segment that has continued to grow dramatically. Pundits project these costs will reach $6 trillion dollars by the year 2050 for the US alone, unless something is changed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Fixing this problem does not require expensive technology or new products.  It requires leadership.
				It requires that we work together across the entire academic community. It requires that we identify,
				validate and  build consensus around models that we can all support and implement.  It requires that we
				be creative in building these models.  It requires  that we abandon ivory tower and silos thinking and
				work together and with the community.  However, most importantly it requires that we open our eyes and
				hearts to all solutions and work together to make them even better.
			</p>

			<p>
				When supported by a consensus of thought leaders medical products have historically moved into the
				main stream reaching 50% or greater penetration within five years or less
				(eg many pharmaceutical products).  Without such support treatments no matter how well designed and
				documented rarely reach 10% penetration.  Vavici Foundation is a non profit that will work with the
				top  academic community to identify, validate and create consensus around the kinds of business models
				we need to shift the focus of health care back to wellness, prevention and curative care.
