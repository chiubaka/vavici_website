			<h1>Tara Sheahan</h1>

			<p>
				Tara Sheahan is the founder of Conscious Global Leadership, an organization whose mission is to support leadership development through mindfulness training and emotional intelligence.  CGL’s curriculum is results-oriented, and designed for personal and business growth.

			</p>
			<p>
				Trained as an elite athlete in cross-country skiing, she found her dream job as a VP in sports marketing and television.  She left the corporate world to become ‘super Mom,’ and with husband Casey, CEO of Patagonia, raised two young boys.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Her most valuable life training came through contracting Lyme disease in her mid-30’s. Losing the ability to walk, think, or function without pain, she searched for that ‘magic pill’ to cure herself, and discovered that true healing must happen through an understanding of the body/mind connection.   She spent the next 15 years becoming an expert in the ‘art of inner listening,’ using meditation and mindfulness practices to understand how our thoughts influence our health, well-being and success.  Sheahan recovered from chronic illness to nearly qualify for the 2006 Winter Olympic Games, at the age of 45.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through immersions, workshops, private coaching and mentoring, Sheahan has introduced and taught mindfulness at eBay, The Aspen Institute, the World Caring Conference, New York’s “Peaceweek,” and with corporate clients and impact leaders across the world.
