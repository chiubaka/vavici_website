      <b>PROBLEM</b>
      <br><br>
      Despite the tens of billions invested in research and initiatives to treat obesity and diabetes, things have gotten worse NOT better.  Currently over half (60%) of the US population is overweight, nearly half (40%) of the US population is obese, and an alarming one third of the US population is projected to have type 2 diabetes by the year 2050.  Not only are our new R&D efforts not helping, but none of our wellness initiatives are having an impact either.
      <br><br>
      Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are reversible.  Many academic thought leaders know that most type 2 diabetes is curable in less than six months if given the right treatment.  Curing diabetes is not limited to new diabetics, but includes those who have had diabetes for decades.  Data reported by IDM suggests cure rates could be as high as 95%.  Yet our primary care doctors do not even treat obesity and those that treat type 2 diabetes treat it as a chronic incurable disease.  This is because instead of being trained to identify and treat the root cause of the type 2 diabetes, they have been taught to focus almost exclusively on addressing disease symptoms. This means managing blood glucose and disease complications like renal disease, retinopathy, and debilitating ulcers.  Most have little or no training in managing obesity.  The results have been disastrous.  Millions of Americans now suffer and even die from side effects of obesity and diabetes diseases that we have the means to both prevent and cure.
      <br><br>
      Obesity and type 2 diabetes now represent the single largest contributor to US healthcare costs and to our healthcare crisis.  Estimated at over $1 Trillion dollars annually we now spend one in every three US healthcare dollars on obesity and type 2 diabetes.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <p>
      <b>SOLUTIONS</b>
      <br><br>
      We need to enable ALL our primary care doctors to provide the kind of root cause based treatments that can slow, halt, and ultimately reverse obesity and diabetes. These are treatments and approaches using validated methodologies that go well beyond traditional wellness programs that frequently run without doctor supervision. These are treatments that can and will reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes and which can only be administered properly when doctors are involved.  This paves the way for large-scale prevention and treatment that can change the course of our healthcare crisis. It may not reverse severe end organ damage, but it can eliminate the disease that will lead to progression and it can set the stage for therapeutic interventions that now have a chance to treat end organ damage. Yet most efforts to treat obesity and diabetes focus on wellness programs that dis-intermediate or exclude physician involvement.  While these are important and helpful, they are clearly not enough.
      <br><br>
      If training most of our doctors to use Viagra for impotence moved this product from nothing to nearly 90% market penetration in less than three years, imagine what training all our doctors to treat obesity and diabetes can do in three years.
      <br><br>
      VAVICI uses a state of the art web-based platform to work with thought leaders, payors, and doctors to make proper patient treatment commercially feasible.  This platform empowers and engages both physicians and patients to take control and to seek and identify the specific root causes and solutions that will work for each individual patient. This is NOT a one size fits all, but a personalized medicine approach that can only be done with a physician.
      <br><br>
      The VAVICI platform will create a massive database integrating both outcomes and interventions allowing both physicians and patients to work together to crowd source the data needed to know what works.  A frequent complaint in the community is the regular appearance of a new fad diet or “miracle” supplement recommendation.  These are almost always based on insufficient data and very limited patient experience.  While a single patient’s data might not be meaningful, VAVICI will be able to empower patients and doctors to aggregate data from thousands perhaps millions of patients. By creating collaborative communities of doctors and patients, we can assemble the data to convincingly prove what works and build the unified support needed to make real change.  In a world where opposing interests easily outspend wellness initiatives one hundred to one, there is no room for egos and self interest we must all come together as one.
