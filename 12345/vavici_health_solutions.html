			PROBLEM 
			<p>
				Despite the tens of billions invested in research and initiatives to treat obesity and diabetes, 
				things have gotten worse NOT better.  Currently over half (60%) of the US population is overweight, 
				nearly half (40%) of the US population is obese, and an alarming one third of the US population is projected 
				to have type 2 diabetes by the year 2050.  Not only are our new research and development efforts not helping, 
				but none of our wellness initiatives are having an impact either. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Both obesity and type 2 diabetes are reversible.  Many academic thought leaders know that most 
				type 2 diabetes is curable in less than six months if given the right treatment.  
				Curing diabetes is not limited to new diabetics, but includes those who have had diabetes for decades.  
				Data reported by IDM suggests cure rates could be as high as 95%.  
				Yet our primary care doctors do not even treat obesity and those that treat type 2 diabetes 
				treat it as a chronic incurable disease.  This is because instead of being trained to identify and treat 
				the root causes of the type 2 diabetes, they have been taught to focus almost exclusively 
				on addressing disease symptoms.  This means managing blood glucose and disease complications like 
				renal disease, retinopathy, and debilitating ulcers.  Most have little or no training in managing obesity.  
				The results have been disastrous.  Millions of Americans now suffer and even die from side effects 
				of obesity and diabetes diseases that we have the means to both prevent and cure.
			</p>

			<p>
				Obesity and type 2 diabetes now represent the single largest contributor to US healthcare costs 
				and to our healthcare crisis.  Estimated at over $1 Trillion dollars annually we now spend one in every three 
				US healthcare dollars on obesity and type 2 diabetes.
			</p>
			<p>
			SOLUTION
			<p>
				We need to enable ALL our primary care doctors to provide the kind of root cause based treatments 
				that can slow, halt, and ultimately reverse obesity and diabetes.   These are treatments and 
				approaches using validated methodologies that go well beyond traditional wellness programs 
				that frequently run without doctor supervision.  These are treatments that can and will reverse 
				obesity and type 2 diabetes and which can only be administered properly when doctors are involved.  
				This paves the way for large-scale prevention and treatment that can change the course of our 
				healthcare crisis.  It may not reverse severe end organ damage, but it can eliminate the disease 
				that will lead to progression and it can set the stage for therapeutic interventions that 
				now have a chance to treat end organ damage.  Yet most efforts to treat obesity and diabetes 
				focus on wellness programs that dis-intermediate or exclude physician involvement.  
				While these are important and helpful, they are clearly not enough.			
			
			</p>	
			<p>
				If training most of our doctors to use Viagra for impotence moved this product from nothing 
				to nearly 90% market penetration in less than three years, imagine what training all
				our doctors to treat obesity and diabetes can do in three years.			
			
			</p>	
			<p>
				VAVICI uses a state of the art web-based platform to work with thought leaders, payors, 
				and doctors to make proper patient treatment commercially feasible.  This platform empowers 
				and engages both physicians and patients to take control and to seek and identify the specific root 
				causes and solutions that will work for each individual patient.   This is NOT a one size fits all, 
				but a personalized medicine approach that can only be done with a physician.
			</p>
			<p>
				The VAVICI platform will create a massive database integrating both outcomes and 
				interventions allowing both physicians and patients to work together to crowd source 
				the data needed to know what works.  A frequent complaint in the community is the regular 
				appearance of a new fad diet or “miracle” supplement recommendation.  
				These are almost always based on insufficient data and very limited patient experience.  
				While a single patient’s data might not be meaningful, VAVICI will be able to empower patients 
				and doctors to aggregate data from thousands perhaps millions of patients.  By creating 
				collaborative communities of doctors and patients, we can assemble the data to convincingly 
				prove what works and build the unified support needed to make real change.  In a world where 
				opposing interests easily outspend wellness initiatives one hundred to one, there is no room for 
				egos and self interest we must all come together as one.
