               Over the past 30 years, Richard T. Minoff has built his global c
 areer as a pharmaceutical and life sciences
 commercialization and marketing strategist, and brand visio
 nary. During the past 30 years, he
 ’
 s launched over 100 brands
 (and companies) including many medical breakthroughs and billi
 onaire blockbusters such as Avastin
 ®
 , Glivec
 ®
 , Diovan
 ®
 ,
 Herceptin GC
 ®
 , Lamisil
 ®
 , Neoral
 ®
 , Perjeta
 ®
 and Sandostatin LAR
 ®
 .<br><br>
 After cutting his business and marketing teeth at GlaxoSmithKli
 ne, where he enjoyed a fast-rise through the ranks and
 gained important broad-based skills from several management ass
 ignments in brand management, government &
 public affairs and human resources, he joined Wyeth Pharm
 aceuticals. At Wyeth, Richard once again rose quickly
 through the organization where he became known for his lau
 nch and turn-around expertise, including the launch of a
 new division where during a three year period as Director
 of Marketing & New Product Development, he grew the
 business five-fold with innovative, groundbreaking strategies
 that are today
 ’
 s marketing cornerstones. <br><br>
 Following these client-side experiences, Rich joined the m
 arketing consulting and agency/ communications side of
 the
 business where he extended his global marketing experienc
 e/ expertise. He is often been turned to as an industry
 thought leader/expert in global brand development, commerc
 ialization/business strategy including pre-launch & launch
 planning,  integrated marketing communications, advocate
 development, and marketing excellence. Two firms that he
 helped launch and build, Interlink Healthcare Communications (
 IHC), and Dorland Global Corporation, illustrate Rich
 ’
 s
 entrepreneurial drive, resourcefulness and spirit. At IHC, a  di
 vision of ICC Lowe, he launched the business and grew it into
 an award-winning  global specialty firm employing 125 peopl
 e with offices in Lawrenceville, NJ and London. After
 accomplishing all he could IHC, Rich joined Dorland Global to re-
 launch and rejuvenate this once venerable but dying
 business which was heading to closure. Over the next five y
 ears as Managing Partner, he relaunched and rebuilt the firm
 into the 2
 nd
 largest independent healthcare agency in the world, and
 a powerhouse top 10 agency employing over 175
 people in Philadelphia, San Francisco, New York and London. D
 uring this time, he launched 4 new divisions, and grew
 sales and profits more than ten-fold. In 2007 he negotiated t
 he sale of the business to Huntsworth PLC and stayed on as
 President & CEO for two years. <br><br>

 Never one to stay idle, Rich then decided to launch his third succ
 essful business enterprise as Managing Partner of 1
 Global Partners LLC, a leading-edge, boutique pharmaceutica
 l and life sciences consultancy. This highly successful firm
 has helped many large pharma, small biotech and pharma start-u
 ps develop competitive advantage in their markets. 1
 Global Partners focuses on three core pillars designed to h
 elp organizations achieve their stretch goals: 1) strategi
 c
 planning and commercialization, 2) marketing consulting
 and life cycle management, and 3) building high performance
 organizations. Today Rich continues to lead the business
 as Managing Partner.
 As a long-time educator, Rich has also enjoyed his adjunct
 faculty engagements at The Wharton School of Business,
 Villanova Graduate School of Communications and LaSalle Univ
 ersity. In addition, he
 ’
 s guest lectured at such institutions
 as West Virginia
 ’
 s P.I. Reed School of Journalism, the University of Connecticut
 School of Pharmacy and School of Business,
 and the R. H. Smith School of Business at the University of M
 aryland. Since 2011 Rich has been an Associate Professor
 of
 Pharmaceutical & Healthcare Business at USciences
 ’
 Mayes College of Healthcare Business and Policy. <br><br>
 In addition to his business and academic interests, Rich o
 ften gives plenary lectures at public and private company
 marketing/management conferences and delivers executive e
 ducation seminars on global brand development, brand
 positioning, commercialization strategy, integrated market
 ing communications and patient
 compliance/adherence/persistency. He enjoys publishing ar
 ticles in trade-related journals and is often interviewed by
 industry editors for commentary on a wide-range of subj
 ects. For years Rich has been on the Editorial Board of
 Pharmaceutical Commerce
 , and the Board of Advisors of Oxbridge Pharma Ltd (UK) an
 d Symbiomix Pharmaceuticals.
 Always looking to give back, he has found time to sit on the
 Advisory Boards of the R.H. Smith School of Business at the
 University of Maryland, the Open University School of Busines
 s (UK), the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the
 Arthritis Foundation.  <br><br>
 Rich graduated from the University of Connecticut with
 his BA cum laude and the R. H. Smith School of Business at the
 University of Maryland with his MBA.
