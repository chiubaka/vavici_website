             <p>
               Over the past 30 years, Richard T. Minoff has built his global career as a pharmaceutical and life sciences commercialization and marketing strategist, and brand visionary. During the past 30 years, he’s launched over 100 brands (and companies) including many medical breakthroughs and billionaire blockbusters such as Avastin ® , Glivec ® , Diovan ® , Herceptin GC ® , Lamisil ® , Neoral ® , Perjeta ® and Sandostatin LAR ® .
   <br><br>
   After cutting his business and marketing teeth at GlaxoSmithKline, where he enjoyed a fast-rise through the ranks and gained important broad-based skills from several management assignments in brand management, government & public affairs and human resources, he joined Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. At Wyeth, Richard once again rose quickly through the organization where he became known for his launch and turn-around expertise, including the launch of a new division where during a three year period as Director of Marketing & New Product Development, he grew the business five-fold with innovative, groundbreaking strategies that are today’s marketing cornerstones.
   <br><br>
   Following these client-side experiences, Rich joined the marketing consulting and agency/communications side of the business where he extended his global marketing experience/ expertise. He is often been turned to as an industry thought leader/expert in global brand development, commercialization/business strategy including pre-launch & launch planning, integrated marketing communications, advocate development, and marketing excellence. Two firms that he helped launch and build, Interlink Healthcare Communications (IHC), and Dorland Global Corporation, illustrate Rich’s entrepreneurial drive, resourcefulness and spirit. At IHC, a division of ICC Lowe, he launched the business and grew it into an award-winning global specialty firm employing 125 people with offices in Lawrenceville, NJ and London. After accomplishing all he could IHC, Rich joined Dorland Global to re- launch and rejuvenate this once venerable but dying business which was heading to closure. Over the next five years as Managing Partner, he relaunched and rebuilt the firm into the 2 nd largest independent healthcare agency in the world, and a powerhouse top 10 agency employing over 175 people in Philadelphia, San Francisco, New York and London. During this time, he launched 4 new divisions, and grew sales and profits more than ten-fold. In 2007 he negotiated the sale of the business to Huntsworth PLC and stayed on as President & CEO for two years.
   <br><br>
   Never one to stay idle, Rich then decided to launch his third successful business enterprise as Managing Partner of 1 Global Partners LLC, a leading-edge, boutique pharmaceutical and life sciences consultancy. This highly successful firm has helped many large pharma, small biotech and pharma start-ups develop competitive advantage in their markets. Global Partners focuses on three core pillars designed to help organizations achieve their stretch goals: 1) strategic planning and commercialization, 2) marketing consulting and life cycle management, and 3) building high performance organizations. Today Rich continues to lead the business as Managing Partner. As a long-time educator, Rich has also enjoyed his adjunct faculty engagements at The Wharton School of Business, Villanova Graduate School of Communications and LaSalle University. In addition, he’s guest lectured at such institutions as West Virginia’s P.I. Reed School of Journalism, the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy and School of Business, and the R. H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. Since 2011 Rich has been an Associate Professor of Pharmaceutical & Healthcare Business at USciences ’ Mayes College of Healthcare Business and Policy.
   <br><br>
   In addition to his business and academic interests, Rich often gives plenary lectures at public and private company marketing/management conferences and delivers executive education seminars on global brand development, brand positioning, commercialization strategy, integrated marketing communications and patient compliance/adherence/persistence. He enjoys publishing articles in trade-related journals and is often interviewed by industry editors for commentary on a wide-range of subjects. For years Rich has been on the Editorial Board of Pharmaceutical Commerce , and the Board of Advisors of Oxbridge Pharma Ltd (UK) and Symbiomix Pharmaceuticals. Always looking to give back, he has found time to sit on the Advisory Boards of the R.H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland, the Open University School of Business (UK), the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the Arthritis Foundation.
   <br><br>
   Rich graduated from the University of Connecticut with his BA cum laude and the R.H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland with his MBA.
